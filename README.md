# RoutineSync

RoutineSync is a task management web application built with React that allows users to create, view, and manage scheduled tasks with recurrence options. The app integrates with a Turso database for persistence, uses Grafana Cloud with Loki for logging, and leverages cron-job.org for email reminders.

## Features

- Create tasks with name, description, schedule time, and recurrence options
- View active and archived tasks
- Delete tasks
- UI Access Key authentication
- Responsive design with loading states
- Recurrence options: Once, Daily, Alternate Days, Weekly, Monthly
- Real-time validation for future scheduling
- Email reminders for tasks with dynamically generated email body and subject using a chat model(LLM)
